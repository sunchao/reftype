This is the log I kept while writing proof for my type system.

<2013-02-19 Tue>

Cannot check expression like:

  let x = {a, a.f} in x.g end

The reason is permission for a.f is encumbered while checking
x.g.

<2013-03-04 Mon>

Right now I am using a special target 0.0 to represent
the world target. However, this causes much problem in
transformation. Maybe we don't need to represent the "world" target
at all.

<2013-03-05 Tue>

Looks like we need a special treatment on shared type.
For shared type, it should be associated with no target, since all
effects are mapped to the world object, and we enforce that
the input and output both have write shared effects.

Checking shared targets should be pretty easy, suppose we have a
expression a.b.c...f, then on the path from f to a, any of them
is shared type, then the target should be shared, otherwise it
will be unique, and have a set and tgtmap associated.

[after a lot of changes...]

A problem occured when proving s.u,
we need to have this unique permission in the output. However,
the current transformation only takes reftgts as input, and thus
will produce a nesting fact about the result value, which is
not correct.


Let's consider the four possible cases:

base (e)       field  (f)      result targets      result effects
unique         unique          unique {e.f}        X e.f
unique         shared          shared              X shared
shared         unique
shared         shared

<2013-03-21 Thu>

In the typing rules for read, we have a restriction
that the object target set should be disjoint with the
key sets of field target set. This is because the case:

(if x < 3 then a else a.f).f

To type check the above, we first need to type check
if x < 3 then a else a.f, and get following permission as output:

\exists z \exists r
    (r == r_a \/ r == r' +
    z(r'.all -> 0 + P(r')) + z(r'.all -> 0 + P(r')) --+-
    \exists r_f z(r.f -> r_f + r_f.all -> 0 + P(r_f)))

(assuming f is unique)

The input effect for above is "read a.f"

Then, to check the whole expression, we have "write a.f" as
input effect, and we have essentially the same permission
as above except the fraction z is removed.

The problem is we cannot use this permission to read field f,
since we need (\exists r_f (r.f -> r_f + r_f.all -> 0 + P(r_f)))
to check the "then" case, but this permission is encumbered
by the "else" case.

<2013-05-05 Sun>

When checking E.F, we need to differentiate the cases when
E is shared or borrow. When E is shared, we should produce a
read effect on the special "shared" target directly. When E
is unique (which only happens when E is a method parameter), then
we should produce a read effect on E.F.

(added later)

I thought a lot about how to represent "shared" targets. There
are three options initially:

1) put it into set, using a special number, like 0
2) put it into tgtmap, using a special entry, like 0->0
3) use a extra bool, to indicate if resulting targets include shared.

For option 1), the main problem is it adds extra complexity to the
other operations and theorems. For instance, when we do methtymatch,
we need to do extra check for each parameter, to see it's unique or
shared. If later, we should use 0 as its target. When we converting
tgtmap to efxmap, we need to do extra processing, so that the
converted efxmap can later generate the right permission
for shared: 0.0 -> 0.

For option 2), the main problem is some of existing
assumptions/proofs need to be redone. For instance, one important
assumption right now is for every tgtmap GM and efxmap XM in
output/expr, GM <= XM. This won't be true if we allow 0->0 in GM.

I chose option 3) at end. The biggest advantage is it won't violate
many theorems I had so far, so it's easier to adapt. Also, it makes
things more clear by using a distinct "shared" flag - if we put
shared target in either set or tgtmap, then many operations on
set/tgtmap need to treat the shared target differently than other
values.


<2013-05-07 Tue>

I always had the wrong impression that for consume effect on a.f,
it converts to:

  input: \exists r_f (r_a.f -> r_f, r_f.all -> 0, P(r_f))
  output: empty

but instead, maybe we should keep the permission on r_a.f -> r_f.
It doesn't like to make any difference for the current design, since
once a unique field is consumed, it is never allowed to be read/write
again. Therefore, it is safe to set it to be empty. But, it would
be more precise to make output permission to be:

  output: \exists r_f (r_a.f -> r.f, empty, P(r_f))

Then, if the type system is flow-sensitive, we can restore
the permission by assigning this field to something else.

Maybe we can define a extra rule for efx`join

  efx`join/X: efx`join efx/consume efx/write efx/write.

Update (<2013-05-08 Wed>): This may not work. Suppose we pass
the target to a method parameter on which there's write effect.
Inside the method body, the target may not be written.

Also, a direct affect from above is that, before I disallow join
operations between consume and read/write. Instead, these should
be legal (same for expose.)

For expose effect on a.f, the input and output permission should both be:

  \exists r_f (r_a.f -> r_f, r_f.all < null.all, P(r_f))

Notice that here "f" is annoated as unique. With this expose effect,
we cannot restore class invariant on object referred by "a". For instance,
we cannot pass "a" to a unique method parameter. This is solved right now,
because a unique method parameter is transformed into consume effects on
all of a's fields, and a consume effect is incompatible with a expose
effect.

ABOUT FROM TYPE

I think it should be able to bring "from" type into my current
system. The "from" type is only used on method return value. Currently,
method return value can be unique or shared. If the return value is typed
unique, and we pass permission

  r.all -> 0, r.all -> 0 ---+- (effects)

to return value, then all permissions from effect are marked as consumed.

<2013-05-09 Thu>

There are two restrictions on tWrite.

1. after a unique field is consumed, there's no way to "restore"
the permission, even in some cases it is perfectly possible.
(for instance, assign a new object to the consumed immediately after.)

2. expressions like a.f = a.f.g is not allowed. (checking a.f.g
requires a "packed" field permission on a.f, but the same permission
should be kept unpacked on the left side.


<2013-05-13 Mon>

It turns out my current definition for reftype is still not precise
enough. For shared reference, it doesn't actually need the
target information,since its only target is the special "world" object.
For unique reference, its target is unchanged.

Now I have two choices. First, I could define shared reftype as:

  reftype/shared : nonnull -> nat -> reftype.

and unique reftype as:

  reftype/unique : nonnull -> nat -> set -> tgtmap -> reftype.

But the ugly part is, unique reference can also be coming from shared,
and thus we need to encode shared target in reftype/unique.
Also, how about borrowed references? Can they use the same reftype/unique?
Obviously NO!

My current definition, instead, is as follows:

  reftype/ : ty -> set -> tgtmap -> reftype.

For a well-formed shared reftype, it should have empty set, and the
only element in tgtmap is the shared target.


<2013-05-13 Mon>

I was trying to prove that if XM1 <= XM2, XM1 => Pi1, XM2 => Pi2,
then Pi1 implies Pi2. However, this doesn't apply to "expose"
effect, as it produces shared permission for unique references.

  expose: \exists r_f (r.f->r_f,r_f.all<null.all,P(r_f))

Thinking again, I think I made a wrong definition for
converting expose effect. For instance, write effect join
expose effect "should" produce a expose effect. But, if we convert
expose like above, we won't get permission for the write effect.


<2013-05-14 Tue>

I also made a wrong definition for consume effect.

Currently, the output permission for consume effect on a.f is:

  \exists r_f (r_a.f->r_f, P(r_f))

However, if we consume the object a as whole, then we won't be able
to keep the field permission on a.f. A more conservative way is to
use empty permission as output. That is, once consumed, we lost
every hope of restoring the permission.

 A tricker question is about expose effect. Like consume, one could also
expose a entire object, and thus the current definition:

  \exists r_f (r_a.f->r_f, r_f.all < null.all, P(r_f))

won't work. We can change it to the following:

  \exists r_f (r_a.f->r_f, r_f.all->0, P(r_f)) < null.all

And then, we need to be more conservative about expose: expose
will produce a write effect on shared target. We then can type check
write /\ expose = expose.


<2013-05-16 Thu>

Yesterday's discussion with Prof. Boyland was helpful. Regarding
expose effect, I ignored one fact: after exposing a target like
x.u.v, x.u will be *totally messed up*, since the invariant for object
refered by x.u will be broken. Therefore, we need to change our system
to accomodate this case.

The easiest way to handle this case is to only allow expose
on the object level, all exposes on fields are treated as consume.
It's hard to track expose effect on arbitrary level field, given
current design of tgtmap in our system.

For read and write effects, we only need to track on the first level
because of the way method effects are declared. For consume and expose
effects, it would be nice if we can track them on arbitrary level.
However, this poses problems:

  how to convert these *arbitrary level* effects into permissions?
I spend a longtime last summer trying to find a nice and elegant
solution to this, but failed.

Also, it is important to remember that, read and write effects are
on field permission, i.e., r.f -> r_f, while expose and consume
effects are on object permission, i.e., r_f.all -> 0.


<2013-05-17 Fri>

Another issue I neglected is *local effect*. When we have
expression like the following:

  let x = new C in x

In current system, expression *new C* will take a new location,
and use it as result target. Then, this target needs to *flow* out
of the let-expression, so that in future we can track effects on
reference x (for instance, x.u won't get consumed twice).

The problem is, at the point that we are out of the let-expression,
we lost track on the information on x: we don't know its type anymore.

Looks like not a problem, if target indeed *flow* out of the
let-expression, for instance, like the following:

  let y =
    let x = new C in x.f end
  in a.u = y end

then we don't need to know anything about x when we are in body
of y. Same if we replace *x.f* with *x*. Therefore, our old approach
to this problem still works.


<2013-05-18 Sat>

Looks like we can *restore* field permission in some limited way.
If we have expression: x.u = new C, then for all object targets G
that x refers to, we can search for all consume effects on

  g.f \forall g \in G

and then remove them from the existing efxmap.


<2013-06-02 Sun>

I redefined cxt yesterday. Now it uses the map signature. One motivation
for this is I don't need to carry wf-cxt around in each theorem about
cxt. In cxt, every object is bound to a distinct location, a set and
a target map.

As usual, shared tgt needs special attention. My original idea is to
use a empty set and a singleton tgtmap for shared tgt. However, this
is not good because tgtmap needs to be associated with effects, and
we don't want reading a literal shared object x produces any effect.

A proposal is to treat shared tgts same as others while constructing cxt.
Then, we handle them specially in set+nat2tgtmap. In this process,
we check each location's type, and if it's shared, we insert a special
value in the resulting tgtmap.

We then need to prove that, given a set+nat2tgtmap relation, and
a tgtmap2efxmap relation. If we convert the result efxmap to a set of
permissions, and if the set is of the same class. Then, we can
*transform* the permissions (say Pi) into the following format:

  PF(x) , PF(x) --|- Pi

while PF(x) is field permission.

However, this proposal requires many changes on existing proof. Also,
it doesn't look right. It is possible for a method to have effect
directly on x.f, where x is a shared parameter, instead of have effect
on shared. Therefore, we'd better produce effect on the target x.f
in this case, instead of converting to effects on shared in set+nat2tgtmap.
But, if we have a effect on x.f.g, while f is a shared field, then
we need to produce a effect on shared, since getting from x.f to
x.f.g requires permission on shared.
(edited: above paragraph is *wrong*, see <2013-06-03 Mon> log)

This poses a problem: let's say we are checking

  let x = if 3 > y then a.f else b in x.g

while f and g are both shared. In this example, following the above
thought, we would generate "read b.g" effect from the "else"
branch, and generate "read shared" effect from the "then" branch.
However, the input effect *cannot* include both, since they are
not compatible.

In general, once we produced a effect on shared, we need to find out
all other effects on shared parameters, and eliminate them. Sometimes,
we need to promote the effect on shared too. For instance, if
we have a "read shared" effect, and another "write x.f" effect, then
we need to eliminate the latter, and promote the former to "write shared".

This looks like complex enough to implement. I need to think more on it.


<2013-06-03 Mon>

A continue from yesterday's thought. In turns of effects annotation, it
is *impossible* to have an effect annotation on a shared parameter. Since
on the one hand, effects will be translated to field permissions on the
parameter object, and on the other hand, the shared annotation is
translated to: x.all <- 0.owned, which is useless since we would never be
able to get anything out of this (unless you know you have effects on
all fields of x, then you can get permission for 0.owned, but this is
incredibly unnecessary because why don't one just annotate x as shared?)

Therefore, we should require shared parameter associated with no effect
annotation (just like unique parameters). In other words, only borrowed
parameter can have effect annotations.

So now we are back to the old question, how should we handle shared parameters?
We could associate them with (set/0, (tgtmap/1 z (set/1 z))) in cxt, but then
we won't type check reftyping/lit, since it produces effects/0. Also, this
doesn't translate to permissions smoothly. When reading a object reference,
it should produce a objequal relation.


Another topic: for unique parameter, we could use similar approach as shared
parameter. That is, when a unique parameter is consumed, we mark it by putting
it in a set (like the set for exposed unique parameter that we are using
right now) in output. Also, we check if this set is compatible with the result
efxmap (the efxmap should not contain any consume effect on any field of any
object in the set). Then, input permission could either contain some field
permission for a object or the whole permission, depending on whether the object
is in the set or in efxmap. One benefit for this approach is, we don't have
to generate a encumbered permission for unique paramter, instead we can just
use the whole permission, which reduces complexity.


<2013-06-04 Tue>

Problem when I try to prove reftyping-frame. Currently, I have output effects
like this:

 effects/ : set -> efxmap -> effects

 set is all objects that are exposed, and efxmap is all effects on fields
 (include read, write and consume).

When converting effects into input permission, I take context into consideration
too. For each unique parameter x in context, we check if it's in set. If so,
we create a permission x.all <- 0.all. If not, we create an encumbered
permission:

  \Pi_f --|- x.all

The problem is, reftyping-frame requires, if we have two effects:
(effects/ S1 XM1) and (effects/ S2 XM2), and S1 <= S2, XM1 <= XM2.
Then, after converting them seperately to permissions Pi1 and Pi2, we need to
show that Pi2 implies Pi1, Pi3, for some Pi3. However, we cannot infer
x.all <- 0.all from \Pi_f --|- x.all.

One proposal is to have another set in effects:

  effects/ : set -> set -> efxmap -> effects.

which contains all parameters that are consumed. But, this still will not solve
the problem.


<2013-06-06 Thu>

My current way of converting targets is still wrong. For a field read, if
the field is shared, we'll give it a shared-tgtmap as result type. However,
this will get converted to a encumbered permission on shared permission, which
is not good, since x.f shouldn't require any permission from shared, if
x is unique and f is shared. Thus, a better way is to check f's type when
producing output, and don't produce any encumbered permission if f is shared.


<2013-06-10 Mon>

Currently I am writing a test case for my type system. This raises questions
about let-expression. First, I think it would be possible to handle chained
field reads through let-expression. For instance, if we have a expression:

  let x = a.u in E

then, it *may* be possible to consume a.u.f1, and a.u.f2 in E, while both f1
and f2 are unique fields. We need to implement this in the *substitution* rules.

Another question is *whether we can handle expose effect in a simple way?*
I still don't want to give up on expose effect, even if we can only handle
a small subset of cases for it. But, I don't want to make any radical change
on what I have right now.


<2013-06-14 Fri>

While writing the test case, I found a problem in my current
definition. For classes without any field, my system won't be able to
handle them. This is because set+set2tgtmap is now a partial mapping.

What I have is two options:

1. Change how effects is defined. For instance, add an extra set
   which contains all consumed objects. This approach should work.
   However, it adds more complexity due to interactions between the
   set and efxmap. For instance, we need to make sure there's no
   overlapping between keys in efxmap and elements in the set, since
   a object cannot be both consumed and read/write.

2. Change set+set2tgtmap and other few things. We can represent this
   if we allow empty inner-efxmap as entry in efxmap. It gets
   converted to empty permission. On the other hand, the unique
   parameter is converted to empty --+- Pi, so we can get the whole
   permission for Pi easily. We need to empty inner-efxmap simply
   because we have to keep a record when the object is consumed.

Another problem is checking method call. We need to check aliasing
when passing arguments to a method call. For instance, argument a and
b maybe aliasing, and if the method is annotated with, for instance,
read a.f and write b.f, then it should not check.

To make sure this won't happen, we can do a extra check in
ref-calltyping. But it is quite tedious to do. Suppose we have two
efxmaps M1 and M2, and we are ready to join them together. Then, we
need to check that:

  1. read effects in M1 do not overlap with write and consume
     effects in M2,
  2. read effects in M2 do not overlap with write and consume effects
     in M1.


<2013-06-19 Wed>

Think about how to check the following exps:

1. x.head = new Node(3,x.head)

2. n = new Node(3, x.head)
   x.head = n

3. for (n = x.head; n.next != null; n = n.next) { ... }

4. n = new Node(3, x.head)
   if (..) x.head = n

Editted: <2013-08-04 Sun> I think these cases are possible to
implement, provided that:

1. instead of transforming read/write/consume effects to packed
permissions, transforming them to unpacked permissions with variables,
in other words, outputs with arbitrary level of "exists". We then
need to establish a relation between inner-efxmap/efxmap and output.
2. allow a little bit flow-sensitivity, e.g., allow join operation
between read/write and consume, but not the other way around.
3. allow consumed field permission to be restored by later on
assigning it a new object.

*More notes*:
(3) can be transformed to a while loop with a "frame" object that
simulate updatable local variable.


<2013-06-30 Sun>

It turns out I couldn't say something like:

  if XM1 <= XM2, and XM1 => Pi1, XM2 => Pi2, then
  exists Pi3, such that Pi2 <==> Pi1 , Pi3

The reason is for read effect - to create a permission for
the effect, we create a "fracperm" that sort of like a function that
takes a fraction as parameter. Then, when we define methmap2progtype,
we can plug-in the fraction.

However, because we don't know what precisely is the fraction, we have
no way to get it from a "whole" fraction. The fraction variable could
even be greater than one! Thus, we can only prove a slightly less useful
fact:

  if XM1 <= XM2, and XM1 => Pi1, XM1 => Out1,
     XM2 => Pi2, XM2 => Out2, AND IF
  Pi1 | E => Out1, then
  Pi2 | E => Out2, Out1 => Out2.

This is the frame-rule for reftyping.


<2013-07-06 Sat>

In my current type system, there are two places that introduce new
bindings: *let-expression* and *calling method* (include new).
However, these two are a little bit difference, the new binding for
the former is put into the explicit context and later will be
subsituted. For the latter, it is not so.

Since we do explicit substitution, we don't need to create any new
binding for the result of method call, since we don't need to worry
about aliasing. The only possibility for aliasing on result of method
call is when it is later assigned to a let-binding, in which case we
will handle via the substitution.


Another tricky problem that I spent sometime thinking today is the
several test cases that I'm trying to check with my type system. For
the first example:

  x.head = x.head.next

(which is quite common in linked list manipulation). Here, suppose
both *head* and *next* are unique fields.

The expression "x.head.next" will produce a "read x.head.next" effect,
and the whole expression will produce a "consume x.head" and a "write
x.head" effect. In ideal, however, we would like to cancel the consume
effect with, since the permission for *x.head* is immediately restored
after being consumed.

First, we would pass in the whole permission for *x.head*:

  \exists rh. (x.head -> rh + rh.all->0 + P(rh))

Then we unpack it to be read for write:

  x.head -> rh + rh.all->0 + P(rh)

Problem arise when we need to be read for x.head.next, since my
current system requires the permission to be packed again for
converting from a "read" effect. However, this way we will lose track
of the read permission.

One proposal would be to convert read and write effects to unpacked
permissions, that is:

  write x.head ===> [rh] rx.head->rh + rh.all->0 + P(rh)

THen, checking "x.head.next" with above permission will give us:

  [rg] rg.all->0 + P(rg) + (rg.all->0 + P(rg)) ---|-
             \exists rh. (x.head -> rh + rh.all->0 + P(rh))

Which is still not right: we packed the permission for x.head, again,
too early.

In ideal world, we want checking "x.head.next" to produce a
permission:

  [rg] rg.all->0 + P(rg) + (rg.all->0 + P(rg)) --|- rh.all->0 +
  rx.head->rh + P(rh)

This way, we still keep the field permission, and thus can use it to
check the write.

<2013-07-28 Sun>

Regarding creating read permission
  For read effects, maybe we can just convert them to some concrete
  fraction permission, like 1/2. This is possible under the current
  systems because when checking method call, we require effects for
  each argument to be mutually disjoint. Thus, a read effect will not
  be used to check more than one argument. However, this is not so
  desireable, since we may loosen this restriction in future.

- TODO: define conversion for read effect


<2013-07-30 Tue>

A use technique for debugging Twelf program. When your proof becomes
large and contains lots of variables, usually it's quite easy to
accidentally unify different variables, and thus will get you "output
converage error". This is notoriously difficult to debug. One way is
to explicitly give names to those implicit variables, so Twelf will
give you an error when it tries to unify them. The other way, which I
found recently, is to define a "fake" theorem, which takes no input,
and produces the exact output that the theorem requires. Then, you can
insert this fake theorem to each point in your proof, and check if the
proof passes. This can help you to further localize where the
unification happens, and thus provides a easier way to identity the bug.


<2013-07-30 Tue>

Another problem when checking an expression that consumes a whole
object. In current system, we convert unique parameter in context to a
encumbered permission. Then, when we are consuming a unique object, we
know that we have all the fields for that object, and therefore we can
get back the whole permission for the object. However, after
consumption, the encumbered permission is lost, and thus we cannot
convert context to the same permission before.

It's helpful to think when we need to use the encumbered permission.
The only place we need it is in consuming whole object, and this won't
happen twice.


<2013-08-03 Sat>

Another DAMN HARD problem! In proving write, if I can check E2
with some permission:

  E |- e2 : t ! X

Then I need to show that X augmented with consume effects on targets
of e2, then result will be a whole permission, instead of fraction
permission. So then I can consume it by passing to some unique field.

But, how can I show this?

Maybe I can do case analysis on the output format. The input
permission be split into two parts, the part that is equal to the
original permission generated by X, and the rest. Then I can use frame
rule to show that the output is in a certain format, and given

<2013-08-06 Tue>

I've been stucked on this problem for a while: suppose we


<2013-08-10 Sat>

For these few days I'm trying to simplify the definitions for
conversion so that checking "read" would be simplier (right now it has
lots of duplicated code). One idea is instead of generate something
like:

  x == r \/ ...,
  (r.all -> 0, P(r)) , (r.all -> 0, P(r)) --|- (Pi_1, Pi_2, .., Pi_n)

generate the following:

  x == r1 \/ x == r2 \/ ... \/ x == r_n
  ((r1.all -> 0, P(r1)) , (r1.all -> 0, P(r1)) --|- r_f1 -> 0) ,
  ((r2.all -> 0, P(r2)) , (r2.all -> 0, P(r2)) --|- r_f2 -> 0) ,
  ...
  ((rn.all -> 0, P(rn)) , (rn.all -> 0, P(rn)) --|- r_fn -> 0)

One main disadvantage for the first approach is, it contains different
cases. For one, n may be 0, in which case we cannot encumber the
permission for r from "empty".

The second approach doesn't work though. Consider checking expression
e.f, first we suppose that checking e gives us the output formatted in
the second apprach. But then, we need to convert the disjunction into
a sequence of conditionals, then use this to get a single permission
for r, and the encumbered permission for it, much like the second part
of the first approach. Then, after checking read, we cannot go back to

Thinking about how to prove the `let` case.
Given a let expression like this:

  let x = e1 in e2

Depending on the type of e1 and e2, we have the following cases:

- e1: shared, e2: shared: nothing needs to be done
- e1: unique, e2: shared: nothing needs to be done
- e1: unique, e2: shared: nothing needs to be done, since the targets
  of e1 won't be in the targets of e2.
- e1: unique, e2: unique: targets of e1 might be in both the targets
     and effects of e2, in which case we need to do the substitution.

Also, think about how to do substitution in this case:

  x == r1 \/ ... \/ x == rn \/ x == o, Pi_o, Pi_o --|- Pi_1,
  y == r1' \/ ... \/ y == rn' \/ y == o', Pi_o', Pi_o' --|- x.f

The problem I'm thing at present:

  Given a let expression:

    let x = e1 in e2

  How to prove it?

First, with induction hypothesis, we can show that e1 can be proved.
That is, we can take the environment, output (both targets and effects) from
checking e1, and convert them to input & output, respectively, and
show that the same expression e1 can be type checked under the FP
system. Same with e2, we can show that with the *augmented*
environment, we can prove e2 similarly.

Now the question is how to show the *whole* expression can be proved.
This is where *substitution* is needed: we need to first do
substitution on the targets and effects from checking the whole
expression, and then show that after converting the result to input &
output, we can check the same expression under FP.

For instance, with the following example:

  let x = if true then y else z in x.f

After substitution, the result target will be { y.f, z.f }, and
result effects will be { read x.f, read z.f }.

Then, we can show that with the permission converted from the above
effects, we can check the whole expression.

Following the previous thought, we still need to tackle some tough
problems.

Suppose the expression to check is: *let x = e1 in e2*, and suppose we
have the effects from checking *e1*, say *X1*. Now, by induction
hypothesis, we can take *X1* and convert it to a set of input
permissions *Pi1*, and output *Out1*. In addition, we know that we can
(sort of) check e1 with *Pi1* and *Out1*.

Also, for *e2*, we have the effects *X2*, in which the variable *x* may
appear. Same as above, we can use induction hypothesis to get a set of
input permissions *Pi2*, and output *Out2*. We can check *e2* under
FP with *Pi2* and *Out2*.

After substitution, we get a new effect *X3*. With this new effect we
can get a new input permission *Pi3*, and new output *Out4*

We need to show that permission *Pi3* can be split into two parts:
*Pi1* and *Pi4*, so that with the frame rule we can check *e1* with
induction hypothesis, and then use *envadd* to add *Pi4* to
output *Out1*, and get a new output *Out3*

Then, we need to show that *Out3* can be transformed into a certain
format, which can be used to check *e2* (Again, we need to use frame
rule to do this).

Lastly, we need to show that the output after checking *e2* can be
transformed into *Out4*, so that the whole expression can be checked.

Here I try to summarize the thought about how to prove *let*
expression. In twelf, it is:

reftyping/let
   : reftyping N CM MM B E (result/expr (reftype/ NN C GS) XX1)
     -> reftype2ty (reftype/ NN C GS) (ty/ NN A C)
     -> ({x} cxt`update B N (cxt-info/ x (ty/ NN A C)) (BF x))
     -> ({x} reftyping (s N) CM MM (BF x) (F x)
          (result/expr (reftype/ NN2 C2 GS2) XX2))
     -> compatible GS XX2
     -> subst-targets GS N GS2 GS3
     -> subst-effects GS N XX2 XX3
     -> effects`join XX1 XX3 XX
     -> reftyping N CM MM B (let E F) (result/expr (reftype/ NN2 C2 GS3) XX).

Suppose the expression is:

  let x = e1 in e2

For this expression to be type checked, e1 should type check
with output target *GS* and effect *XX1*. By adding to context
with the binding for *x*, e2 should also type check with output
target *GS2* and effect *XX2*. Moreover, *XX2* has to be *compatible*
with *GS*, which generally means (under fractional permissions)
*XX2* should NOT contain effects on targets that are *encumbered* in
the output for checking e1.

After performing explicit substitution on *GS2* and *XX2*, we
get *GS3* and *XX3* respectively. The whole expression can then type
check with output effect *XX*, which is the joined effects of *XX1* and *XX3*.

Now thinking about proving. First, with induction hypothesis, we can
check e1 and e2 (with augmented context). Suppose that by checking e1
and e2, we get *XX1* and *XX2*
as output effects, respectively.

Also, by induction hypothesis, we know that we can convert *XX1* and *XX2*
to input permission and output, with which we can check the same
expressions under fractional permissions. Suppose that *XX1* converted
to *Pi1* (input permission) and *Out1* (permission output),  and *XX2*
converted to *Pi2* and *Out2*.

To show the whole expression can type check under fractional
permission, we need to show 1) there exists an input permission *Pi* and
output *Out*, which are converted from *XX*, which is the joined
effects of *XX1* and *XX3*, and 2) the whole expression can be
checked with *Pi* and *Out*.

There are several things/steps we need to prove here. First, Given the
permission *Pi*, we need to show that it can be splitted into
permission *Pi1* and another permission *Pi3*, so that *Pi1* can be
checked (with frame rule). Second, we need to show that after
adding *Pi3* into the output *Out1*, we can somehow transform the
output into a proper format, which should contain *Pi2* and some
encumbered permission *Pi4* for x. Finally, we show that e2 can be checked
with *Pi2*, and that the output: *Out2*, combined with *Pi4*, can be
transformed into the output *Out*.

Let's use a simple example:

  let x = { a, b, c.g } in (x.f = 3; x)

Here we use a shortcut "{a,b,c.f}" to represents some branching
expression that will be either a, or b, or c.f. This is e1, and e2 is
x.f = 3.

The effect *XX1* for e1 is { read c.k }, and
the effect *XX2* for e2 is { write x.f }, and after substitution
effect *XX3* is { write a.f, write b.f, write c.g }.
The joined effect *XX* is same as *XX3* in this case, since write
includes read.

Then, *XX1* get converted to 1/2*Pi_c.k (Pi1), *XX2* converted to
Pi_x.f (Pi2), and *XX* converted to Pi_a.f + Pi_b.f + Pi_c.g (Pi).
Here Pi_c.k is a shortcut for
\exists rk. (rc.k->rk, rk == 0 ? empty : (P(rk) + rk.all->0))
(suppose field k is maybe-null and unique).

Clearly given Pi we can obtain *Pi1* and another permission *Pi3*:

  Pi1: Pi_c.k, Pi3: Pi_a.f + Pi_b.f

We can check e1 with *Pi1*. The
output *Out1* is in the following format:

\exists x. (x == a \/ x == b \/ x == o \/ Pi_o, Pi_o --|- Pi_c.k)

By adding *Pi3* to this output, we have:

\exists x. (x == a \/ x == b \/ x == o \/ Pi_o + Pi_o --|- Pi_c.k +
Pi_a.f + Pi_b.f)

which can be transformed to:

\exists x. (Pi_x.f + Pi_x.f --|- Pi_x + Pi_x --|- (Pi_a.f + Pi_b.f + Pi_c.k))

Here, Pi_x.f --|- Pi_x + Pi_x --|- (Pi_c.k + Pi_a.f + Pi_b.f) is the encumbered
permission *Pi4* in above, and Pi_x.f is *Pi2*. We can then check e2
with the latter, and then add *Pi4* to *Out2*. As last step, we need
to show after adding *Pi4* to *Out2*, it can be transformed to *Out*.

The *Out2* will look like this:

\exists r. (r == x



Let's put more details! Notice that every effect *XX* is represented
as a triple (*M*,*S*,*Q*), where *M* represents all read/write
effects on field targets, *S* represents consume effects on field
targets, and *Q* represents consume effects on object targets. (a
field target is a (objectID,fieldID) pair, while a object target is
just an objectID.).

Now following the above, let's say *XX1* consists of
(M1,S1,Q1), *XX2* consists of (M2,S2,Q2), *XX3* consists of
(M3,S3,Q3), and *XX* consists of (M,S,Q).
